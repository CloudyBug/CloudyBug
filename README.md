### About me:
I'm a second-year computer science student, just starting to explore more substantial projects. 
Any progress on here will likely be quite slow, as most of my energy currently goes to my course.

### Interests
- Cybersecurity
- Writing fast, neat, efficient code!
- Debugging/testing/verification
